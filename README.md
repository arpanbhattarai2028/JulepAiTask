# 🍽️ Julep AI – Foodie Tour Workflow

This project is a Julep AI workflow that creates a weather-aware, one-day foodie tour for any city. It:

- Gets today’s weather for each city
- Suggests indoor or outdoor dining
- Recommends 3 iconic local dishes
- Finds top-rated restaurants for those dishes
- Crafts a breakfast-to-dinner foodie tour narrative

## 💡 Example Input

```json
{ "cities": ["Tokyo", "Florence", "San Francisco"] }

I was not able to complete the whole task. Though I got used to with the tasks, agents, sessions, executions. The dashboard was kinda new to me I regret not booking a meeting ahead of time. I would love to implement this manually in backend using Julep api in future.
